# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Road-Accident-Using-Power-BI
Overall, the objectives of this research were met. Through visualization, data analysis aids pupils in comprehending  concepts.

Power BI has taken the world of business intelligence, data visualization and analytics by storm. Power BI is an online 
service that enables searching data, transforming it, visualizing it, and sharing the developed reports and dashboards 
with other users in the same or different department/organizations or even with the general public. As of February 2017, 
more than 200,000 organizations across 205 countries are using Power BI. Power BI is having a free option that has 
adequate features and functionality , it has become a serious contender for use as a business intelligence platform in 
small and medium organizations. One of the innovative features of Power BI is its Quick Insights feature (Michael Hart, 
2017) that is built on a growing set of advanced analytical algorithms. After uploading a dataset to Power BI, a click of a 
button can be used to invoke this feature that automatically builds many reports based on its analysis of the data, 
without any human intervention being required. This also helps reduce human errors, in calculations and statistical 
techniques, which lead to un-verifiable research. Accepting even Excel spreadsheets as input, Power BI is easy to use and 
ripe for adoption as a platform for Research Data Analysis. In this paper, an attempt has been made to show how easily a
dataset of research data can be transformed by Power BI into a set of analytical reports and dashboards, and which can 
be shared with ease.

Road accident is world main problem. Every day we watch the news of road accident on the TV, Internet. The main 
causes of road accident are human behavior. The major causes of road accident are human carelessness in our country.
